# 🎵 Genre Defined Music App

Welcome to the **Genre Defined Music App**! This app uses the power of the Seno API to provide users with a personalized music creation experience based on their input.

## 🚀 Overview

The Genre Defined Music App is designed to turn your prompts into genre-specific and lyrics-specific songs tailored just for you. Whether you're writing a song or exploring new musical ideas, this app lets you enjoy music that feels uniquely yours.

## 📝 How It Works

1. **User Provides Input**: Start by giving us a prompt. It could be a few words, a phrase, or a specific theme you want your song to be about.
   
2. **Magic Happens**: Behind the scenes, we frame your input and send it to the Seno API, which processes the data to create a song that matches your genre and lyrics preferences.

3. **Receive Your Song**: Get back a song that fits your specifications—whether it's pop, rock, hip-hop, or any genre you choose.

4. **Make Adjustments**: Don't love it yet? Make changes to the song until it perfectly reflects your vision.

5. **Enjoy Your Song**: Listen to your tailor-made masterpiece and enjoy the personalized music experience powered by the Seno API.
